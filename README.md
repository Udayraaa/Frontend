# How to connect to SQL Database

To preface I only know how to use SSMS so good luck with other things if you use them.

Download SSMS: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16&redirectedfrom=MSDN

Once in SSMS you should be on a "Connect to Server" screen

Ensure the following:

```Server Type: Database Engine
Server Name: tcp:cis4375.database.windows.net
Authentication: Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA
User name: [YOUR UH EMAIL]
```
Microsoft should then ask you to sign in 

Press "Connect"

**Boom** you're connected.

_Congratulations~~_
